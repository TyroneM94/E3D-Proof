Problem statement:

In a digitally charged world traditional/analog learning is becoming redundant and isn’t best serving emerging generations who are already more technologically literate. 

Solution:

Create a digital platform focused around immersive and engaging learning which provides a solution for people who are more technologically inclined and/or feel as if they are not able to reach their highest intellectual potential through traditional/analog teaching mediums. 

Who is this app for:

This app is an inclusive platform for any individual who has a passion for learning and sharing their own knowledge that is enhanced by its strong focus on building community and fostering strong engagement. 

Why is this app useful and important:

We are contributing to resolving the problem of non-inclusivity within the learning stratosphere through the use of this AR/VR application. Our quest is to make learning more interactive and engaging whilst still being practical and sensible. Our aim is to also make tools that shy away from traditional/analog learning structure more accessible for people who may have any sort of learning disability or may have any neurodivergencies. 

How are we planning on doing all of this:

Through the use of unity and vuforia we create a landscape where we attach our information thus creating the environment for the user to travel through, like a continuous quest for knowledge.
Other examples include our emphasis on captivating images and sound, we use beta waves throughout the entire experience which calms and relaxes the mind to create a soothing environment for learning whilst still promoting focus, concentration and improved memory.
